# Advice generator app

This is my solution to the [Advice generator app](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db) challenge on Frontend Mentor. In this project I have used the Advice Slip API to generate random quotes of advice.

You can view the app [here](https://sarahc-dev.github.io/advice-generator-app/).

## Tools

- React
- TypeScript
- CSS
- Fetch API
- GitHub pages

## What I learnt

This was my first time using TypeScript and so I learnt about adding type safety to projects. I learnt about compiling TypeScript, how to assign a type to a variable, interfaces as well as how to handle click events and fetching data from an API in TypeScript.

I also learnt how to implement a spinner from the `react-spinners` npm package.

## The challenge

The challenge was to build out the advice generator app using the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com) and get it looking as close to the design (below) as possible.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon
